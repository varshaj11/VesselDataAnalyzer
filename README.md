# Vessel Data Analyzer : https://vesseldataanalyzer.onrender.com/

# Introduction
This project is the backend design for a Vessel Data Analyzer System, implemented using PyCharm. 
It displays vessel data at ports, covering vessels, berths, and port calls.  
The code cleanses and processes the data, and displays a comparison with a bar graph generated from the data.
The generated outputs are connected to Streamlit.

# Features
- Reads vessel call data from a CSV file.
- Cleans and processes the dataset (like date formatting, turnaround time calculation).
- Generates key insights such as average cargo tonnage and turnaround time.
- Produces a basic visualization (bar chart of cargo tonnage by vessel call ID). 


# Technologies Used 
- PyCharm: IDE designed for python programming.  
- GitHub: Version control and project documentation.  
- Streamlit: an open-source Python framework to deliver dynamic data apps.
